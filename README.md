# bot-and-political-tweet-detection
Machine Learning Model to detect twitter bots and political tweets<br>
<br>
In this project we will follow several stages:<br>
<br>
Data annotation<br>
Feature extraction<br>
Model building and training<br>
Competition<br>
<br>
##Data annotation
<br>
We are starting the first and most significant part of our machine learning course project. Our task is to label a part of the provided data that will be used as training data. The accuracy of our models will depend on the quality of the data we label, so we need to be careful during this stage.
